# Titan Smart Skimmer
**Senior Mechanical Engineering Capstone Project**  
California State University, Fullerton

---

## Overview
The **Titan Smart Skimmer** is a **mobile, remotely operated oil-skimming watercraft** designed to efficiently remove oil from the surface of contaminated water. Unlike traditional oil-spill remediation systems—which are often bulky, stationary, and costly—this design targets **small-to-medium spill events** and **hard-to-reach environments** using a lightweight, modular approach.

This year-long capstone progressed from **system design and analysis** to **physical fabrication and integration**, resulting in a **nearly complete functional prototype**.

---

## Engineering Objectives
- Design a **lightweight, mobile oil-skimming watercraft**
- Develop a **mechanical belt-driven skimming system** using oleophilic materials
- Ensure **buoyancy, stability, and structural integrity** under variable payloads
- Minimize cost and weight using **direct digital manufacturing (3D printing)**
- Validate performance through **analytical modeling, FEA, and CFD**
- Fabricate and assemble a **working prototype within budget constraints**

## System Architecture

### Oil-Skimming System
- Conveyor-style belt using **oleophilic PET film**
- Continuously lifts oil from the water surface
- Integrated scraper deposits oil into an onboard reservoir

### Conveyor Belt Apparatus
- Aluminum frame fabricated in-house
- **Tip-up tail tensioning** for easy belt installation
- **Jack-screw adjustment** to compensate for belt stretch
- Independently driven motor and speed controller

### Watercraft & Buoyancy
- Dual **modular PETG pontoons**
- Aluminum cross-bracing for structural rigidity
- Modular design allows buoyancy scaling based on payload

### Controls & Propulsion
- Remote-controlled propulsion and steering
- Rudder + servo + propeller system
- Electronics enclosed in a sealed below-deck controls box

## Scope & Limitations
Due to COVID-19 restrictions:
- Extended in-water testing was limited
- Oleophilic belt performance testing was not completed
- Renewable energy integration (solar) was deferred

The project was intentionally documented as a **handoff-ready platform** for future development.
